zhongli_00722.wav|Knowing her, she must have again quoted that adage she is most fond of when proclaiming that decree to her people:
zhongli_00750.wav|I had expected them to do no more than the adepti, To come to the defense of Liyue. But when all was said and done,
zhongli_00379.wav|I owe you both an apology. I hastily agreed to what appeared to be an equitable agreement with this zombie child, when perhaps I should have undertaken further due diligence.

zhongli_00318.wav|Tonight, I shall take you both to an old hole-in-the-wall, praised throughout Liyue.
